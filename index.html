  <h2 class="my-name">I’m Umar Bello Tafida, CISSP</h2>
  <p>I’m a Muslim from Rabah, Sokoto State, Nigeriapassionate about technology, leadership, and building digital tools to help my community.  
  With over 3 years’ experience in web development (HTML, CSS & JavaScript), my dream is to turn ideas into solutions that truly help people.</p>

<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Umar Bello Tafida. I’m from Rabah, Sokoto State, Nigeria — and beyond the titles or certificates, I see myself first as someone deeply curious about technology and how it can help people around me.
  </p>
  <p>
    From a young age, I’ve always been the person asking “how does this work?” whether it was fixing small electronics, exploring the internet, or writing my first lines of HTML. Over time, that curiosity grew into purpose: to build tools that bring real value to everyday life.
  </p>
  <p>
    I co-founded <strong>Rabah Technician</strong> to bring digital payment services to rural communities, and although we faced challenges, it taught me resilience and the importance of understanding what people truly need. Now, I’m working on creating my own chat platform, aiming to keep people connected in a simpler, more personal way.

  <h2>Technical & Educational Background</h2>
  <p>
    My journey into technology started with curiosity and a simple desire to make things work better. After completing my National Diploma in Computer Science, I didn’t stop there. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve gained over three years of hands-on experience in web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), completed training in Cisco Networking & Cybersecurity, and explored online courses in programming and software development. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2019, I proudly completed my Diploma in Certified Information Security System Professional on Alison, achieving an A grade — a milestone that strengthened my passion for keeping digital systems secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m continuing my studies in Information Technology at Sokoto State University, driven by the belief that learning never truly stops.

  <h2>Leadership Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond coding and tech, I’ve had the privilege of serving and representing others. As Financial Secretary of the Student Union Government, I learned the importance of transparency and planning. Later, as President of the Rabah Local Government Students Association and Speaker of the Students Representative Assembly (SRA), I developed skills in negotiation, public speaking, and bringing people together.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey continued as National President of the Federation of Rabah Youth Students (FORWS) and Public Relations Officer of the National All Comrade Congress (Northwest). Each role taught me that leadership isn’t just about titles — it’s about listening, adapting, and working to make a difference.
  </p>

<section id="vision">
  <h2>My Vision</h2>
  <p>
    I believe technology isn’t just about code or machines — it’s about people. My dream is to help my community, and Africa as a whole, embrace the new era of AI and AGI so that nobody is left behind.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to see young people in rural areas discovering that they can do big things, farmers using digital tools to boost their harvests, and local businesses growing with simple software that speaks their language and fits their reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Step by step, project by project, my goal is to turn ideas into practical tools that truly improve lives — not just in cities, but everywhere.
